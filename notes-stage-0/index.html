<p><b>The Web</b> starts with a user who, through a browser, accesses the internet. The internet is the largest network of computers in the world. Computers that host the files that make up the web are called servers. HTTP is the main protocol of the web.</p>

<p><b>A Browser</b> interprets and displays web pages that are text documents written in HTML. </p>

<p><b>HTML</b>, or <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>, documents are the heart of the web. 
It includes text content, markup, references to other documents and links to other pages.
  Here's a link to some more <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Elements>information</a>.

<p><b>HTML vocaabulary</b><dl><dd><b>Tag</b></dd><dt>an HTML tag is always enclosed in angeled brackets. These contain the instructions that the browser reads.

  <dd><b>Element</b><dt>an HTML element describes everything between the opening and closing tags</dt></dd>
<dd><b>Attribute</b></dd><dt>an attribute is a property of an HTML element.</dt>

<p><b>Coding</b> is writing text in a language computers can understand, such as HTML. Computers are stupid and can't interpret meaning from text unless unless it is written perfectly.
  However, computers will never also never make erroneous interpretations. If a coder can't remember the details it is possible to simply look them up.
